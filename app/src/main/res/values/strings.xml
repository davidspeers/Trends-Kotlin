        • Trends with Friends is a game that consists of multiple rounds.\n
        • In each round you will be given a word, you will then need to think of a word that people google with that
        word.\n
        • Your word and the given word will then be combined to become your query.\n
        • Google Trends will then calculate a score for all the queries in that round.\n
        • At the end of the last round the scores are tallied and whoever has the highest score wins.\n
